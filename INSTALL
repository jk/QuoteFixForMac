Installing QuoteFix
===================

- build the plug-in:
  python setup.py py2app
- copy or move dist/QuoteFix.mailbundle to ~/Library/Mail/Bundles/

If you're hacking the code, you can use py2app's '-A' commandline option to
make 'alias builds', which build much faster and are much smaller. However,
these are pinned to your local setup (the plug-in just contains a bunch of
symlinks to the sources) so make sure to remove the '-A' when you're making
a distribution build.

Snow Leopard notes
------------------

In Snow Leopard, mail plug-ins must declare, in their Info.plist, with
which versions of Mail.app and Message.framework they are compatible. See
the 'plist' dict in setup.py (the 'SupportedPluginCompatibilityUUIDs' key).

Also, it seems that making alias builds (as described above) don't seem to
work properly on Snow Leopard.
